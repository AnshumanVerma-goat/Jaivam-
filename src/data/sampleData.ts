  {
    question: "What is organic farming?",
    answer: "Organic farming is a method of agriculture that avoids the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and other artificial inputs. It focuses on maintaining soil health through natural processes."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I start composting?",
    answer: "To start composting: 1) Choose a shady spot for your compost pile, 2) Layer green materials (food scraps, grass) with brown materials (leaves, twigs), 3) Keep it moist but not wet, 4) Turn the pile regularly."
  },
  {
    question: "What are natural pest control methods?",
    answer: "Natural pest control methods include: companion planting, using neem oil spray, introducing beneficial insects, crop rotation, and maintaining healthy soil."
  }

export const faqData: FaqItem[] = [
    { question: "How do I improve my soil health?", answer: "Improving soil health starts with regular testing. Try adding organic compost, rotating your crops each season, and planting cover crops like legumes to add nitrogen back into the soil." },
    { question: "What is the best way to save water?", answer: "Drip irrigation is highly effective as it delivers water directly to the plant roots, minimizing evaporation. Also, consider collecting rainwater in tanks for later use." },
    { question: "How to deal with pests naturally?", answer: "Neem oil solution is a great organic pesticide. You can also introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs that eat aphids. Planting marigolds around your crops can also deter many common pests." },
    { question: "When should I harvest my coconuts?", answer: "For tender coconut water, harvest around 6-7 months. For mature coconuts for oil or cooking, wait until they are 11-12 months old, when the husk is brown and dry." },
    { question: "What is a good organic fertilizer?", answer: "Composted farm waste is excellent. You can also use cow dung manure (after aging it), vermicompost, or bone meal. These release nutrients slowly and improve soil structure." },
